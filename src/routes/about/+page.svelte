    <p class="font-lg text-gray-800 text-center my-4 max-w-[650px]">
        This portal supports a multidisciplinary group of researchers and managers across government agencies and academic institutions in the United States. Our community of practice (CoP) shares an interest in creating a more robust hydro-terrestrial modeling ecosystem and strives to learn from one another’s work.

        The IHTM community aims to advance science by integrating process understanding and operational practices, enhance national capabilities for prediction and scenario-testing, and further government agency missions on integrated water resources management through collaborations.
    </p>
    <p class="font-lg text-gray-800 text-center my-4 max-w-[720px]">
        Creating a seamless national IHTM capability requires close coordination across scientific, operational, and resource management communities. As such, our CoP emphasizes the “research to operations to research (R2O2R) pipeline,” using actionable intelligence and responding to advances in science and technology to address interconnected societal challenges.
